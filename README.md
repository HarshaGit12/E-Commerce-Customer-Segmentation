# E-Commerce-Customer-Segmentation
**The purpose of this project is to create customer segmentations by using similarity between products purchased between the users **

# Project Overview:
**From the E-Commerce transaction data, only unique values from the Product Description column were taken and Natural Language Processing techniques were applied to convert to numerical data**

**Then K-Means clustering is applied to get 12 Product Categories from the Product Description data**

**Then using the Product Categories , I tried to group the customers into different clusters using similarity between products purchased between the users**

**For this, I have grouped the data using Customer_ID to get a single row data for each customer. Then K-Means clustering is applied to get 6 Customer categories (clusters)**

**Then Data Visualization like Avg UnitPrice per cluster, Avg Quantity of products per cluster is calculated and the Product Categories present in each Customer Category is also shown**

**This kind of customer segmentation will help in coming up with dedicated marketing strategies like Targeted discounts, Targeted Ads, Special offers and will aid us in recommending products to different user bases**
